# Maze
This code is using Stack and recursive function for finding a path in the input maze.
## General steps
At first getting the number of rows and columns from input and read the Maze map from position.txt file.
Then by calling recursive function **findPath** and using two instances of stack (one for rows and another for columns), print the path from start point (top left) to the end point (bottom right).
